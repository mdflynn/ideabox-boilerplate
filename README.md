## Overview & Learning Goals
For our mod 1 group project, we will be building a webpage that lets user add ideas by title and body to the page. The webpage will allow users to save, favorite and delete ideas at will.

Our team will develop/utilize skills relying on JS, HTML and CSS to create functionality on the webpage.


## Progression

7/21: We created our DTR and discussed the project at length. We also built out the basic structure for HTML.

7/22: We worked on Iteration 0, reviewing the HTML file and added the image file as well as making fixes to the HTML.

7/23: On this day we had our first check-in and were advised to divide and conquer rather than implement driver/navigator. We split the work up on the styling of our page and regrouped to assemble the layout of the page in regards to the title/body/save box for mobile view as well as the "filter starred ideas" and "idea card" grid.

7/25: We started with adding query selectors and functionality to the save button, made small changes to css and html. Connected JS to our HTMl file. Attempted to instantiate a class and connect it to our input fields. Reformatted the search bar. Began the README file.

7/26: Built functionality to clear inputs on save button click, checked input values to prevent form from submitting if blank. We also interpolated new idea card to DOM and data model.

7/27: We added date.now to our idea class, added styling to the save button disabled.

7/28: We fixed styling to the border as well as troubleshooting with our addIdea function and added a for loop to saveIdea function.

7/29: We correctly instantiated our class and separated the data model from the DOM to get our newIdea cards displaying correctly. Updated README progression.
